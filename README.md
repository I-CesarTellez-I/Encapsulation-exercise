# Encapsulation-exercise
This exercise was done using one of the characteristics of POO, encapsulation, dedicated to Erick Sang, professor of Programming.
A company requests a program that stores information of 5 employees; Then show the desired information.
It was done with encapsulation which protects the attributes.
In the "Employees" class, 4 variables that are name, age, address and telephone number will be declared and initialized and subsequently encapsulated.
In the "Others" class, four constructors are created with their respective objects (to be able to access the protected attributes). In addition conditional and a (do-while) are used to sort the information and display it according to the interest of the person.
I hope you like the code and thanks for reading.
